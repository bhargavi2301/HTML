   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Embedded Google Map</h1>
       <p>Here's an embedded Google Map of gujrat:</p>
   

       <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3777452.9793631374!2d68.68518863672085!3d22.39441363764604!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3959051f5f0ef795%3A0x861bd887ed54522e!2sGujarat!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1692865753860!5m2!1sen!2sin" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
   
       <p>That's a simple example of embedding a Google Map using an iframe. You can adjust the width and height attributes to control the size of the iframe. You can also add various attributes to customize the behavior of the iframe, such as frameborder, allowfullscreen, etc.</p>

<h3><b>18.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</b></h3>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating web pages, but they have some key differences:<br>
  <b> HTML</b>: HTML has more lenient syntax rules. It allows for certain mistakes like unclosed tags or mixed case tag names, and the document will still render in most browsers.<br>
   <b>XHTML</b>: XHTML is more strict. It follows the rules of XML, which means that all tags must be properly nested, closed, and in lowercase. Even a small error can cause the entire page to break.</p>
   <h3><b>19.What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</b></h3>
   <p>In HTML the formatting tags are divided into two categories:</p>
   <p><b>Logical tags :</b> Logical tags are used to tell the meaning of the enclosed text. The example of the logical tag is &lt stong &gt  &lt /strong &gt tag. When we enclose the text in the strong tag, it tells the browser that enclosed text is more important than other texts.</p>
   <p><b>Physical tags :</b> Physical tags are used to tell the browser how to display the text enclosed in the physical tag.<br> Some of the examples of physical tags are &lt b &gt, &lt big &gt,&lt i &gt.
